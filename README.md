This Python-based Web Vulnerability Scanner is an automated security tool designed to detect multiple types of security flaws in web applications. Using a multi-threaded approach with the ThreadPoolExecutor, it efficiently scans for various vulnerabilities, logs findings, and saves results in a structured format.
Key Features:

âœ… Multi-Threaded Execution: Uses concurrent scanning for faster results.
âœ… Supports Multiple Vulnerabilities: Scans for XSS, SQL Injection, Local File Inclusion (LFI), Command Injection, and Sensitive Data Leaks.
âœ… Customizable Payloads: Reads attack payloads from payloads.yaml, allowing easy customization and expansion.
âœ… Logging & Reporting: Saves results in a structured scan_results.json file and logs critical findings in scanner.log.
âœ… Progress Tracking: Uses tqdm to show real-time progress updates.
âœ… User-Friendly Interface: Simple CLI-based interaction using argparse.
How It Works

    Load Payloads: Reads attack payloads from a YAML file.
    Multi-Threaded Scanning: Simultaneously launches different vulnerability checks.
    Analyze Responses: Detects vulnerabilities based on response patterns and logs findings.
    Save & Display Results: Stores detected vulnerabilities in JSON format and prints findings.
Requirements

To run this Advanced Web Vulnerability Scanner, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
1. System Requirements:

âœ… Python 3.x (Recommended: Python 3.8 or later)
âœ… Internet connection for scanning web applications
2. Python Libraries:

Install the required Python libraries using the following command:

pip install requests tqdm termcolor pyyaml argparse

    requests â†’ Handles HTTP requests to test web vulnerabilities.
    tqdm â†’ Provides a progress bar for better visualization.
    termcolor â†’ Adds colored output for alerts and vulnerability findings.
    pyyaml â†’ Parses the YAML file containing attack payloads.
    argparse â†’ Enables command-line arguments for easy usage.
    logging â†’ Records scan logs for analysis.
    concurrent.futures â†’ Implements multi-threading for fast scanning.

3. Configuration Files:

    payloads.yaml â†’ Stores predefined attack payloads for various vulnerability types.
    scan_results.json â†’ Saves scan results in a structured format.
    scanner.log â†’ Logs detected vulnerabilities and errors.

Uses of the Web Vulnerability Scanner

This tool is designed for penetration testers, ethical hackers, and cybersecurity professionals to automate vulnerability detection in web applications.

ðŸ”¹ Detects the Following Vulnerabilities:

    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) â†’ Identifies script injections that can exploit user sessions.
    SQL Injection (SQLi) â†’ Finds database query manipulations that can expose sensitive data.
    Local File Inclusion (LFI) â†’ Checks for file traversal vulnerabilities.
    Command Injection â†’ Detects server-side command execution vulnerabilities.
    Sensitive Data Leaks â†’ Searches for API keys, credentials, or other exposed data.

ðŸ”¹ Practical Applications:

    Bug Bounty Hunting: Automates vulnerability discovery for security researchers.
    Web Application Security Audits: Helps organizations detect flaws before attackers do.
    Penetration Testing: Aids in assessing the security posture of web applications.
    Educational Use: Helps learners understand how common web exploits work.

How to Use the Scanner?

1. Run the scanner with a target URL:

python scanner.py -u http://example.com

2. Monitor the scan progress in real-time.
3. Review findings in scan_results.json and scanner.log.
4. Take action on detected vulnerabilities.

This scanner is an essential tool for bug hunters, penetration testers, and security professionals looking to automate security assessments efficiently. ðŸš€
